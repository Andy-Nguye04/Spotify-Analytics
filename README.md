# Spotify-Analytics

In depth EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) project surrounding Spotify and Top Hit Songs completed in DSC10 (Intro to Python & Pandas) at University of California, San Diego. Done in collaboration with Ansh Murjal.

EDA is performed through basic - intricate Python and Pandas manipulation of dataframes containing Spotify data containing songs, song durations, valence, pitch, position on charts, artist, key, danceability, energy, loudness, acousticness, tempo, is/not love song, and tempo. Methods used to perform EDA span from Data Frame manipulation, Aggregate Functions, Various Plots, Merging, etc. 

Through deep analysis shown in Questions 6 & 7 we analyze the character traits of US Megahits on the Spotify Top 200 as well as Megahits Globally that are present on the Spotify Top 200. Plots and code are used to show the difference between Megahits and Popular songs released by artists on Spotify.
